Detect copy-pasted and structurally similar code. The inspector identifies
duplicate code, even if modified, as well as common boilerplate or logic that
should be the target of refactoring.

## Overview

We've all had to deal with code smell, and duplicate code is a common source.
While some instances are easy to spot, this type of searching is the perfect
use-case for a helpful CLI tool.

Existing solutions do exist for this purpose, but are often token-based and
rely on string searching methods such as the Rabinâ€“Karp algorithm. Why isn't
this always ideal? Those tools may struggle with code that has wildly varying
identifiers, despite having the same structure and behavior.

And copy-pasted code is but one type of code duplication. Common boilerplate
and repeated logic can be identified as well using jsinspect, since it
doesn't work on tokens - it uses the ASTs of the parsed code.

You have the freedom to specify a threshold determining the smallest subset of
nodes to analyze. This will identify code with a similar structure, based
on the AST node types, e.g. BlockStatement, VariableDeclaration,
ObjectExpression, etc. For copy-paste oriented detection, you can even limit
the search to nodes with matching identifiers.

The tool accepts a list of paths to parse, and outputs any matches along
with a series of 2-way diffs. Any directories among the paths are walked
recursively, and only `.js` files are analyzed. Any `node_modules` dirs are
also ignored. Being built for JavaScript, it also ignores CommonJS require
statements, and AMD define expressions.

## Installation

It can be installed via `npm` using:

``` bash
npm install -g jsinspect
```

## Usage

```
Usage: jsinspect [options] <paths ...>

Duplicate code and structure detection for JavaScript.
Identifier matching is disabled by default. Example use:
jsinspect -t 30 -i ./path/to/src


Options:

  -h, --help                output usage information
  -V, --version             output the version number
  -t, --threshold <number>  minimum size of nodes (default: 15)
  -i, --identifiers         match identifiers
  -D, --no-diff             disable 2-way diffs
  -C, --no-color            disable colors
```

On first use with a project, you may want to run the tool with the following
options, while running explicitly on the lib/src directories, and not the
test/spec dir.

```
jsinspect -t 30 -i ./path/to/src
```

## Integration

It's simple to run jsinspect on your library source as part of a build
process. It will exit with an error code of 0 when no matches are found,
resulting in a passing step, and a positive error code corresponding to its
failure. For example, with Travis CI, you could add the following entries
to your `.travis.yml`:

``` yaml
before_script:
  - "npm install -g jsinspect"

script:
  - "jsinspect -t 30 ./path/to/src"
```

Note that in the above example, we're using a threshold of 30 for detecting
structurally similar code. A lower threshold may work for your build process,
but ~30 should help detect unnecessary boilerplate, while avoiding excessive
output.
