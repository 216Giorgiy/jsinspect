Detect both copy-pasted and structurally similar code. The inspector helps
identify duplicate code, even if modified, as well as common boilerplate or
logic that should be the target of refactoring.

## Overview

We've all had to deal with code smell, and duplicated code is a common source.
While some instances are easy to spot, this type of searching is the perfect
use-case for a helpful CLI tool. Meet the Inspector.

Existing solutions do exist for this purpose, but are often token-based and
rely on string searching methods such as the Rabinâ€“Karp algorithm. Why isn't
this ideal? Those tools tend to struggle with code that has wildly varying
identifiers, despite having the same structure and behavior.

And copy-pasted code is but one type of code duplication. Common boilerplate
and repeated logic can be identified using js-inspector as well, since it
doesn't work on tokens - it uses the ASTs of the parsed code.

You have the freedom to specify a threshold determining the smallest subset of
AST nodes to analyze, as well as an edit distance to enable fuzzy matching.
The tool then accepts a list of paths to parse, and outputs any matches along
with a series of 2-way diffs if enabled. Any directories among the paths are
walked recursively, and only `.js` files are analyzed. Any `node_modules` dirs
are also ignored.

## Installation

It can be installed via `npm` using:

```
npm install -g js-inspector
```

## Usage

```
Usage: js-inspector [options] <paths ...>

Options:

  -h, --help                output usage information
  -V, --version             output the version number
  -f, --fuzzy <number>      max edit distance for fuzzy matching (default: 0)
  -D, --no-diff             disable 2-way diffs
  -t, --threshold <number>  minimum size of nodes (default: 15)
  -C, --no-color            disable colors
```

## Integration

It's simple to run js-inspector on your library source as part a build process.
It will exit with an error code of 0 when no matches are found, resulting in
a passing step, and a positive error code corresponding to its failure.
For example, with Travis CI, you can add the following two entries to your
`.travis.yml`:

```
before_script:
  - "npm install -g js-inspector"

script:
  - "js-inspector -t 25 ./path/to/src"
```

Note that in the above example, we're using a threshold of 25. A lower threshold
may work for your build process, but ~25 should help identify both duplicate
code and unnecessary boilerplate.
