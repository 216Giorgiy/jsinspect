Detect copy-pasted and structurally similar code. The inspector identifies
duplicate code, even if modified, as well as common boilerplate or logic that
should be the target of refactoring.

## Overview

We've all had to deal with code smell, and duplicate code is a common source.
While some instances are easy to spot, this type of searching is the perfect
use-case for a helpful CLI tool.

Existing solutions do exist for this purpose, but are often token-based and
rely on string searching methods such as the Rabinâ€“Karp algorithm. Why isn't
this ideal? Those tools tend to struggle with code that has wildly varying
identifiers, despite having the same structure and behavior.

And copy-pasted code is but one type of code duplication. Common boilerplate
and repeated logic can be identified as well using jsinspect, since it
doesn't work on tokens - it uses the ASTs of the parsed code.

You have the freedom to specify a threshold determining the smallest subset of
AST nodes to analyze, as well as an edit distance to enable fuzzy matching.
By default, this will identify code with a similar structure, based on the
AST node types, e.g. BlockStatement, VariableDeclaration, ObjectExpression, etc.
For copy-paste oriented detection, you can limit the search to nodes with
matching literals or identifiers.

The tool accepts a list of paths to parse, and outputs any matches along
with a series of 2-way diffs if enabled. Any directories among the paths are
walked recursively, and only `.js` files are analyzed. Any `node_modules` dirs
are also ignored.

## Installation

It can be installed via `npm` using:

``` bash
npm install -g jsinspect
```

## Usage

```
Usage: jsinspect [options] <paths ...>

Duplicate code and structure detection for JavaScript.

Identifier matching is enabled by default, while literal
matching is disabled unless specified. The option accepts
a list, and the available types are: boolean, number, and
string. Example use:

jsinspect -t 15 -l boolean,number,string


Options:

  -h, --help                output usage information
  -V, --version             output the version number
  -f, --fuzzy <number>      max distance for fuzzy matching (default: 0)
  -t, --threshold <number>  minimum size of nodes (default: 20)
  -l, --literals <types>    match literals
  -I, --no-identifiers      disable matching identifiers
  -D, --no-diff             disable 2-way diffs
  -C, --no-color            disable colors
```

## Integration

It's simple to run jsinspect on your library source as part of a build
process. It will exit with an error code of 0 when no matches are found,
resulting in a passing step, and a positive error code corresponding to its
failure. For example, with Travis CI, you could add the following entries
to your `.travis.yml`:

``` yaml
before_script:
  - "npm install -g jsinspect"

script:
  - "jsinspect -t 15 ./path/to/src"       # Look for copy-pasted code
  - "jsinspect -I -L -t 30 ./path/to/src" # Look for structural similarities
```

Note that in the above example, we're using a threshold of 30 for detecting
structurally similar code. A lower threshold may work for your build process,
but ~30 should help identify both duplicate code and unnecessary boilerplate,
while avoiding excessive output.
